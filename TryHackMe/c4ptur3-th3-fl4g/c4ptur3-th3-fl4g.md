A beginner level CTF challenge

## Task 1 - Translation & Shifting

For this Task I used [Cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/). As the [github](https://github.com/gchq/CyberChef) page informs us: *"CyberChef is a simple, intuitive web app for carrying out all manner of "cyber" operations within a web browser. These operations include simple encoding like XOR and Base64, more complex encryption like AES, DES and Blowfish, creating binary and hexdumps, compression and decompression of data, calculating hashes and checksums, IPv6 and X.509 parsing, changing character encodings, and much more."*

### Context

*Translate, shift and decode the following; Answers are all case sensitive.*

This one it took me a while to figure out. As we can see, there is an '=' character at the end. This led me to think of Base64. After decoding it to text, I found Morse code. Decoding that, I got a binary code, which I then decoded to text, resulting in ROT47 text. Decoding that, I got a series of decimals. Using Decimal to Text conversion, I finally arrived at the answer.

## Task 2 - Spectrograms

### Context 

*A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time. When applied to an audio signal, spectrograms are sometimes called sonographs, voiceprints, or voicegrams. When the data is represented in a 3D plot they may be called waterfalls.*

### Question - Download the file

#### Hint: Audacity

For this task, a file (**secretaudio.wav**) with a **.wav** extension is provided. The title of the task is **Spectrograms**, and the description explains it. My main interest then, is to observe the spectrogram of this .wav file.

We can do that using a program called [**Audacity**](https://www.audacityteam.org/). Audacity is the world’s most popular free software for recording and editing audio.

With Audacity, we can open the file, and to the left of the waveform of the imported audio, there is a dropdown menu (with a default value of the file name). Clicking it reveals various options, including "Spectrogram view," as shown in the image below:

![Alt text](./imgs/task2/audacity-view.png?raw=true "audacity view")

If we select it, we can see the spectrogram of the audio

![Alt text](./imgs/task2/audacity-secret.png?raw=true "secret in the audio file")

Here we can see the secret message!

The text is clear, but if we wish to "zoom in" on the message, we can filter the frequencies (Hz) via Spectrogram Settings in the dropdown menu. For example, if we filter from a minimum frequency of **1** to a maximum frequency of **5000**, we obtain a "zoomed" view of the spectrogram.

![Alt text](./imgs/task2/audacity-spectrogram-settings.png?raw=true "audacity spectrogram settings")

## Task 3 - Steganography

### Context 

*Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video.*

### Question - Decode the image to reveal the answer.

For this task I used **Steghide**. According to the Steghide's man page: "*Steghide  is  a  steganography program that is able to hide data in various kinds of image‐ and audio‐files. The color‐ respectivly sample‐frequencies are not changed thus making the embedding resistant against first‐order statistical tests.*"

However, as a preliminary step, I checked the file information to ensure that the file is genuinely a **jpg** file and does not contain any hidden data.

Examining the image below, it is evident that the file carries the correct JPEG signature FF D8 FF E0 00 A0 4A 46 49 46 00 01. Additionally, we need to identify the JPEG trailer, which is FF D9. Since there are no additional bytes at the end, everything appears to be in order.

![Alt text](./imgs/task3/file-info.png?raw=true "jpg file info")

As I mentioned before, for the next step I used the Steghide tool.

I execute the command ```steghide info stegosteg.jpg``` to displays info about a file whether it has embedded data or not.

![Alt text](./imgs/task3/steghide-info.png?raw=true "steghide tool info")

Upon responding to the prompt about embedded data, the tool requested a passphrase. I did not find any indication of a passphrase requirement and attempted leaving it blank, which yielded results. I believe that no passphrase was originally set during the hiding process. 

The output reveals information about the embedded file: it's a ```steganopayload2248.txt``` file. The data is encrypted using the **Rijndael-128** algorithm (symmetric key encryption algorithm) in **Cipher Block Chaining** (CBC) mode. It also compressed.

After that I executed the command ```steghide extract -sf stegosteg.jpg``` to extract the file. Then I examinated the content of the file and I got the desired answer!

![Alt text](./imgs/task3/file-secret.png?raw=true "file secret after steghide extract command")

## Task 4 - Security through obscurity

### Context 

*Security through obscurity is the reliance in security engineering on the secrecy of the design or implementation as the main method of providing security for a system or component of a system.*

### Question 1 - *Download and get 'inside' the file. What is the first filename & extension?*

The title of the question makes me suspect that there might be another file inside the current one.

As for the previous Task, I checked the file information and I discovered something interesting:

As we can see, at the end of the file, there isn't the JPEG trailer, which is ```FF D9```, but instead, there is a **.png** filename. 

At this point I investigated what is hidden in the **meme.jpg** file using ```binwalk```. ```binwalk``` is a tool for searching binary images for embedded files and executable code.

Here we can find what we are looking for!

### Question 2 - *Get inside the archive and inspect the file carefully. Find the hidden text.*

The title of the question refers to an archive. From the previous question, we can see that inside the meme.jpg file, there is a RAR archive data file.

We can extract all the data inside the file with the command ```binwalk -e meme.jpg```

As wee can see the command has created a folder called ```_meme.jpg.extracted```. If we go inside, we can see all the files extracted.

We are interested in the RAR archive data, ```122A7.rar```

We can extract the rar file using ```unrar``` tool. ```unrar``` extract files from rar archives.

As we can see, the rar contains a **.png** file called **hackerchat.png**, which is different from the one inside the **meme.jpg** file.

I use the ```exiftool``` tool to read meta information in the file and I found something interesting:

The warning received indicates that there is additional data present in the PNG file beyond the formal end of the PNG file structure.

I then decided to examine this extra data.
